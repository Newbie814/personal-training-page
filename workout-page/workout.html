         <button class="accordion acc-top">What is <span class="rpe">RPE</span>?
           </button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>
        What is RPE? There is a lot of research backing RPE as a way of
        autoregulating workouts. You can go as deep as you want, and often the
        conversation can get really complex. Here's what you need to know: On a
        scale of 1 - 10, how hard was the last few reps of the set. In theory,
        an 8 RPE would mean you would have only been able to do 2 more. 7 would
        mean 3. That's what the Left In Tank column means. Anything over an RPE
        of 6 has got you in the "applying enough stress to this particular
        tissue" range. Those are the sets you want to count.<p>Don't worry about
        it being super accurate, when you're first starting out, anything you do
        is adding benefit. As you progress, what you can handle will increase,
        as well as your ability to judge what you can handle.</p>  <p>This is the
        important thing. Stress applied to the tissue. Sets, workout structure,
        implement - they are all indirect ways of affecting stress, and,
        ultimately, arbitrary.</p>
      </p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion acc-middle">How many <span class="rpe">sets</span>?</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>
        How many sets? <p>Research is pretty clear on this. Hard (sufficient RPE)
        sets per week is the main driver and more important to focus on than
        sets per workout.</p> <p> How many? If you listen to nothing else, listen to
        this: Even one hard set per muscle group a week puts you on the positive
        side of 0.</p> <p>That being said, research, in general, suggests 10-20 sets
        per week, per muscle group. That's really not a lot. That's a good
        thing. That's more time to spend filling our overall activity bucket
        with other activities we may enjoy more. Also, the amount of sets needed
        can very greatly from individual to individual. One person may need 5,
        another person, 25.</p> <p>Keep in mind that you don't get bonus points for how
        "hardcore" your workout is. Your muscles can only grow so fast. Once you
        cross "enough" to elicit an adaptation, every additional set has
        diminishing returns for your progress and increasing demands for your
        recovery time. As with all things human, where this threshold resides is
        greatly variable between humans and can even vary greatly within the
        same human, depending on the circumstances. Any blanket recommendation
        is ultimately arbitrary and is more likely to waste someone's time or be
        harmful than to be correct.</p> <p>Here's my not blanket suggestion. Start low.
        If you're new, had a long layoff, or just new to this type of lifting,
        Start at 1 hard set a week per muscle group per week. If you've been
        working out lately, start at 5.</p> <p>Every couple of weeks, add a set or 2.
        When you get to a point where you notice you're achy consistently,
        overly tired, abnormally moody, or your performance is dropping, drop
        your sets and start over.</p> If you can do that consistently, because your
        "chasing" the correct variable - RPE, rather than arbitrary proxies like
        rep number, even on the back off weeks, we are making progress.
